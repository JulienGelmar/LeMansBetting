                                ALL data will be deleted one week after Le Mans, which is the 23rd of June. Nothing will be kept.<br><br>

                                The website uses a couple of mandatory cookies so it can work. No data is being sent to any third-party and all data is being stored as safe as possible.<br>
                                If a data leak happens, I will take action immediately and notify everyone involved. In case of a (highly unlikely, but not impossible) data leak, all data that is being leaked, is your bet, your Discord ID, a link to your Discord avatar, your Discord refresh token and a remember token.<br>
                                In case this happens please invalidate your access to this application <a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/authorized">HERE</a>.<br><br>

                                You can delete all your data by messaging "nns#9999" in Discord or mailing <a href="mailto:julien@gelmar.app">me here</a>. You can also get to know more about processing your data over this email or reading the source code on <a href="https://github.com/JulienGelmar/LeMansBetting">GitHub</a>.
